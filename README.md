## About

This project explores data mining and feature engineering using synthetic e-commerce data that includes customers, products, orders, and order details. The dataset was carefully generated with realistic business constraints such as customer signup timelines, product pricing, discount structures, and delivery likelihood to simulate real-world scenarios. Using the Featuretools library in Google Colab, various features were engineered through aggregation and transformation primitives to uncover valuable business insights. Key metrics like Line Item Revenue, Average Order Value (AOV), Customer Lifetime Value (CLV), and Average Purchase Frequency (APF) were calculated to assess customer behavior and overall business performance. The analysis also included customer segmentation based on income levels, revealing that mid-to-high income groups (M1–M3) generated the most revenue, while some lower-income segments showed surprising purchasing power—offering new opportunities for targeted promotional strategies. Based on these metrics, an e-commerce performance dashboard was generated to visualize and interpret the data effectively tp provide meaningful insights for strategic decision-making.
